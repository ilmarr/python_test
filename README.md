# python_test
1-st test for python scripts. Public
# Some bullshit or something about it. I don't know anything, it's only testing (Python scripts for example)
# There are some codes, but don't take it very seriously - it can be a normal code from another projects (ches-python for example) only for testing how it works. And my exercises (Python, JS, ...) Don't lost your time, watch codes from more experienced programmer than me in this moment. I will never use it for any commerse - I will delete it in future (than I understand all and start normal project).
